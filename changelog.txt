== Changelog ==

**This is a list detailing changes for past BeyondWords releases. For more information about the current release, see readme.txt.**

= 5.5.0 =

Release date: 2nd July 2025

**Enhancements and Features:**

* [#446](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/446) Fetch button for Block Editor Inspect panel.
    * We've added a Fetch option to the Inspect panel in the BeyondWords Block Editor sidebar.
    * This allows users to retrieve audio that has already been generated in BeyondWords, helping to quickly restore a missing or broken link between the audio and WordPress post, without needing to regenerate the audio.
* Always show the **Generate audio** checkbox in the Block Editor.
    * As part of the Fetch button update the **Generate audio** checkbox is now always shown in the Block Editor.
    * If **Generate audio** is unchecked before a post is saved then audio **will not** be regenerated from the updated post content.
* [#444](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/444) PHP 8.4 support.
    * Run unit and e2e tests against PHP 8.1 and PHP 8.4 in GitHub Actions.

= 5.4.0 =

Release date: 22nd April 2025

**Fixes:**

* [#436](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/436) Article language support in WordPress.
    * Each `POST` and `PUT` request to the BeyondWords REST API now includes the article language.
    * This update ensures compatibility with recent REST API changes and improves support for multilingual websites.
* [#432](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/432) Delete audio and post meta when posts are trashed or deleted.
    * When a post is moved into the trash in WordPress it is now deleted from the BeyondWords dashboard, and all associated BeyondWords post meta data (e.g. the content ID) is also deleted.
    * This resolves REST API error messages caused by `DELETE` requests for content that no longer exists.
    * After this update you will need to regenerate audio again if you restore posts from the trash.

**Enhancements and Features:**

* Tested up to WordPress 6.8.
* [#405](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/405) "Post a review" notice in WordPress admin.
    * A new notice prompts you to review our plugin on the WordPress Plugin Directory.
    * The notice will appear 14 days after activating the plugin, or 14 days after updating to this version (or later) .
    * The message is permanently dismissed once you close it or follow the link to leave a review.
* [#434](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/434) Update Cypress to version 14.

= 5.3.1 =

Release date: 11th February 2025

**Fixes:**

* Replace `esc_js` with `esc_attr` for the player `onload` attribute.
    * Fixes a reported issue where UTF-8 characters in the *Call to Action* setting were not being output correctly.

= 5.3.0 =

Release date: 3rd February 2025

**Enhancements and Features:**

* [426](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/426) Add support for article summarisation.
    * A new "Player Content" field has been added to the post edit screens for both the Block Editor and Classic Editor.
        * Selecting "Summary" in the BeyondWords side panel loads the summarised audio into the player.
        * The default value, "Article," continues to load the full article content.
    * To use this feature, ensure that summarisation is included in your plan and enabled in your BeyondWords dashboard.
* [429](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/429) Add Summarization tab in plugin settings.
    * Adds a link to manage summarization settings for your project, including the summarization voice.

**Fixes**

* Prioritise post-specific player settings.
    * It was previously possible for the plugin settings in the "Player" tab to overwrite any post-specific settings such as the player style.
    * The priority has now been corrected so any post-specific settings will overwrite the plugin settings.
* Fix Clipboard.js error.
    * Replace Clipboard.js script with the WordPress core version to address a console error in the block editor.
* [425](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/425) Update asset URL to Azure Storage.
    * The AMP logo image has been moved from AWS S3 to Azure Storage.

**Codebase Enhancements**

* Refactor React code for the player.
    * Updated the block editor player embed script to align with React players we use in other BeyondWords projects.
    * This included removing the `react-script-tag` dependency.
* Added the `__nextHasNoMarginBottom` property to various components.
    * `__nextHasNoMarginBottom` has been set in various places to address a console warning from WordPress core.
* Updated dependencies.
    * Updated several dependencies including `@mockoon/cli`, `@wordpress/env`, `@wordpress/eslint-plugin`, `@wordpress/scripts`, and `uuid`.
    * Removed unused dependencies.

= 5.2.2 =

Release date: 10th December 2024

**Fixes**

* [423](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/423) Optimise WordPress HTTP calls to BeyondWords REST API.
    * Increase the WordPress default `timeout` param from `5` to `30`. This is to address a reported issue where REST API calls are sometimes timing out in WordPress/PHP before the REST API is able to respond.
    * Also removed the `sslverify` param for API calls. This is no longer recommended.

= 5.2.1 =

Release date: 28th November 2024

**Fixes**

* [#421](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/421) Update WordPress GET voice queries to use scopes.
    * Fixes the issue where multilingual voices were not being shown in voices dropdown menus.
* [#417](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/417) Improve handling of failed REST API requests when syncing settings.
    * Add HTTP status code into failed API credentials validation message to improve debugging for empty response body.
    * Fix the undefined index errors that are logged when REST API responses do not contain the expected structure.
    * Replace transients with object cache to reduce db writes.
    * Add Query Monitor plugin to wp-env local dev config to help with debugging.

= 5.2.0 =

Release date: 22nd November 2024

**Enhancements**

* [#414](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/414) Tested up to WordPress 6.7.
* [#409](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/409) Support the [recommended inline script tag method](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/player/blob/main/doc/getting-started.md) to embed players.
    * ***This opt-in feature is experimental and may change, or be removed, in the near future***.
    * Opt-in to the inline `<script>` tag method of auto-embedding audio players by defining the constant `BEYONDWORDS_PLAYER_INLINE_SCRIPT_TAG` as `true` in your `wp-config.php`.
    * This was added because the recent removal of the deprecated `beyondwords_content_id` filter caused problems for a publisher who had been using it to display an audio player from another post on their homepage.
    * After opting-in, audio players that are auto-prepended to the post body should now use the `beyondwords_content_id` and `beyondwords_project_id` from the associated post being queried within The Loop.
    * A known-issue is the current implementation is currently incompatible with both the *BeyondWords shortcode* and the *BeyondWords player block*. Compatibility will be ensured before this experimental opt-in feature is shipped to all users. In the meantime players added using either the shortcode or player block are unlikely to appear when the `BEYONDWORDS_PLAYER_INLINE_SCRIPT_TAG` is `true`.

**Fixes**

* [#413](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/413) Refactor API calls to prevent "invalid creds" messages
    * Since upgrading to version 5 a few publishers have reported problems with their valid API credentials being flagged as invalid, so the checks we had in place to validate the API Key and Project ID have been updated.
    * API calls to create/update BeyondWords content can now be made with potentially invalid credentials. If this happens (e.g. if your API Key has been revoked) the 401 Unauthorized error code and error message will be stored for your requests and visible in WordPress admin.

= 5.1.0 =

Release date: 30th October 2024

**Fixes**

* [#404](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/404) Bring auto-publish setting into WordPress to fix auto-publishing.
    * In some cases WordPress was publishing audio regardless of the auto-publish setting in the dashboard.
    * After this update any content created with the WordPress plugin will need to be published in the BeyondWords dashboard.
* [#407](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/407) Regenerate audio for all post statuses
    * If a post has a content ID for audio then we now *always* make PUT requests to the BeyondWords REST API when the post is updated.
    * This fixes an issue where the `published` property of audio was not set to `false` when WordPress posts were moved back to `draft` status.
* [#408](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/408) Generate Audio checkbox in Classic Editor doesn't reflect the "Preselect" setting
    * A change in the `v5.0` update meant the "Preselect generate audio" JS script was no longer being enqueued. This should now be fixed.

= 5.0.0 =

Release date: 15th October 2024

**Enhancements**

* [#385](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/385) Extend plugin settings using a tabbed interface.
    * The plugin settings screen has been expanded to include settings from the BeyondWords dashboard, allowing you to set various BeyondWords settings without leaving WordPress.
    * Changes made in WordPress will be immediately copied over to the BeyondWords dashboard when "Save settings" is pressed.
    * Changes made in the BeyondWords dashboard will be copied over to WordPress when you visit the relevant plugin settings tab.

**Breaking changes**

* Legacy audio player support has been removed.
    * The legacy BeyondWords player is no longer natively supported in the WordPress plugin.
    * The standard [BeyondWords Player](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/player/overview) is now the only built-in option for the audio player.
* Remove built-in Elementor compatibility.
    * Basic support for audio generation and auto-player embeds should still work for posts that are created with Elementor, although you will be unable to see a BeyondWords player in the Elementor post edit screens. To view our player in WordPress admin you can temporarily switch to the Block or Classic editors.
    * Refer to our [WordPress filters](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress/wordpress-filters) docs and the [Elementor hooks](https://developers.elementor.com/docs/hooks/) docs if you wish to add Elementor support to your site.
* Stop saving the legacy `beyondwords_podcast_id` param.
    * This change means that posts generated with versions `v5.0.0` and later will not play audio if the plugin is downgraded to `v3.x` or below.
    * If you need to downgrade to `v3.x` after using `v5.x` please contact us for support.
* Remove deprecated filters.
    * A number of deprecated filters have now been removed from the source code.
    * Refer to our [WordPress Filters](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress/wordpress-filters) documentation to view the current filters we provide.

= 4.7.0 =

Release date: 2nd May 2024

**Fixes**

* [#388](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/388) If the post body [has_blocks](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/has_blocks/) then remove the `wpautop` filter before sending it to our REST API. This filter was stripping closing `</p>` tags from empty paragraph blocks.

**Enhancements**

* [#386](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/386) Prepend custom plugin links instead of appending them
* [#384](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/384) Refactoring to improve code quality
* [#388](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/388) Unit tests for empty paragraphs
* Prevent empty `data-beyondwords-marker` attributes

= 4.6.1 =

Release date: 28th March 2024

**Fixes**

* [#378](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/378) Only auto-prepend player for [is_singular](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/is_singular/) queries.

**Enhancements**

* [#373](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/373) Run [Plugin Check (PCP)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-check/) in our GitHub Actions workflow to check we meet the WordPress.org plugin directory coding standards.
    * Includes various minor code updates to resolve the reported errors and warnings.

= 4.6.0 =

Release date: 28th March 2024

**Enhancements**

* To support BeyondWords’ upcoming summarization product, the BeyondWords REST API now expects the post excerpt to be prepended to the body for API requests.
    * If you have enabled "Use excerpts for summaries" in the plugin settings we will now automatically combine the fields. You should not see a difference, or need to make any changes.
    * If you are currently passing a `summary` field to us using another method (e.g. our [beyondwords_content_params](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress/wordpress-filters/beyondwords_content_params) filter) then we should have provided advance notice of this change to you. If this change affects you, and you didn’t hear from us in advance, then please contact [support@beyondwords.io](mailto:support@beyondwords.io).

= 4.5.1 =

Release date: 14th March 2024

**Enhancements**

* Make the BeyondWords column in WP admin sortable.

**Fixes**

* We now only render plugin components on the Post edit screens if the REST API credentials have been validated.
* Improved handling for REST API calls that fail while editing posts. This fixes the following issues:
    * The block editor crashed if the API Key and/or Project ID had not been entered in the plugin settings.
    * The block editor crashed if REST API calls failed for other reasons e.g. network problems.
* Removed a console log intended for debugging.

= 4.5.0 =

Release date: 1st March 2024

**Enhancements**

* Audio content for posts created with a future publish date is now available to preview in the WordPress admin players. To achieve this we handle a `preview_token` returned from the BeyondWords REST API.
* In Site Health and throughout the code, replace "Allowed post types" and "Supported post types" with "Compatible post types" and "Incompatible post types" to improve clarity.

**Code Refactoring**

* A general tidy-up of all code and docs for the public open-source release of our plugin repo at https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin.
* Remove `BEYONDWORDS_DEBUG` constant throughout the code - this was only ever used internally for the legacy player, so it has been removed for the public repo release.
* Prevent side-effects in PHP constructors.

= 4.4.0 =

Release date: 11th January 2024

**Enhancements**

* Tested up to WordPress 6.4.
* Tested up to PHP 8.3.
* Delete audio when *Remove* feature is used. When you *Remove* audio using the Inspect panel we now make a DELETE request to the BeyondWords API to keep WordPress and the BeyondWords dashboard in sync.
* Add BeyondWords version and WordPress version into copied Inspect Panel data.

**Fixes**

* Use optional chaining before accessing properties. This fixes an undefined error when the sidebar is loaded. The issue was reported by Cypress testing in our CI pipeline.

= 4.3.0 =

Release date: 7th December 2023

**Deprecations**

We have renamed and removed some of our WordPress filters to make them simpler to understand and to implement.

The deprecated filters listed below are scheduled to be removed from the code in plugin v5.0, so please migrate to any replacements as soon as possible.

* Filters we have simply renamed (the functionality remains exactly the same):
    * `beyondwords_body_params`: Renamed to `beyondwords_content_params`
    * `beyondwords_player_styles`: Renamed to `beyondwords_settings_player_styles`
    * `beyondwords_post_types`: Renamed to `beyondwords_settings_post_types`
    * `beyondwords_post_statuses`: Renamed to `beyondwords_settings_post_statuses`
* Filters we have removed because there are suitable alternatives:
    * `beyondwords_amp_player_html`: Instead, use the `beyondwords_player_html` filter which is now applied to the player HTML for AMP and non-AMP content.
    * `beyondwords_content`: Instead, set the `body` key in the `beyondwords_content_params` filter
    * `beyondwords_post_metadata`: Instead, set the `metadata` key in the `beyondwords_content_params` filter
    * `beyondwords_post_audio_enabled_blocks`: Instead, refer to our [Filter content](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/filter-content) docs for an alternative.
    * `beyondwords_post_player_enabled`: Instead, return an empty string in the `beyondwords_player_html` filter to hide the player. Alternatively, you can set `published` to `false` in the BeyondWords dashboard.
* Filters we have deprecated because the functionality is no longer required:
    * `beyondwords_js_player_params`: This only applies to the Legacy player which will be removed in plugin v5.0
    * `beyondwords_content_id`: We believe this is not being used, please contact [support@beyondwords.io](mailto:support@beyondwords.io) if you are using this filter.
    * `beyondwords_project_id`: We believe this is not being used, please contact [support@beyondwords.io](mailto:support@beyondwords.io) if you are using this filter.

We have also renamed `PostContentUtils::getBodyJson` to `PostContentUtils::getContentParams`, to match the `beyondwords_content_params` filter name.

= 4.2.4 =

Release date: 15th November 2023

**Fixes**

* Ensure the `$content` param of `Beyondwords\Wordpress\Core\Player\Player::hasCustomPlayer` is a string before using `strpos`.

= 4.2.3 =

Release date: 2nd November 2023

**Fixes**

* Pass full-size (originally uploaded) featured image to the BeyondWords API instead of a cropped thumbnail. The 240x240 thumbnail we replaced was not suitable for some styles of the latest player.

= 4.2.2 =

Release date: 27th October 2023

**Fixes**

* Ensure segment markers are added to the HTML body before we pass it to our REST API. This fixes an issue where "Playback from paragraph" was not working in some cases.
* Update the block control restrictions. This is to fix an issue where the block controls – including the "Audio processing enabled/diabled" toggle – sometimes did not appear when a block was clicked.

= 4.2.1 =

Release date: 12th October 2023

**Enhancements**

* Prevent player analytics events from being recorded in WordPress admin by setting the `{ analyticsConsent: 'none' }` param for admin players.

= 4.2.0 =

Release date: 10th October 2023

**Enhancements**

* Add `[beyondwords_player]` shortcode. See our "WordPress shortcode" docs at [https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress].

**Fixes**

* Ensure an array is always returned for `PlayerStyle::getCachedPlayerStyles()` to prevent PHP warnings.
* For AMP content, the player is no longer auto-prepended if a custom player is found in the content.
* Clean up 'beyondwords_player_style' option on plugin uninstall.

= 4.1.2 =

Release date: 21st September 2023

**Enhancements**

* Added "Large" option into "Player style" plugin setting.

= 4.1.1 =

Release date: 15th September 2023

**Enhancements**

* Tested up to WordPress 6.3.

= 4.1.0 =

Release date: 15th September 2023

**Enhancements**

* "Player style" support.
    * A "Player style" setting has been added to the plugin settings screen where you can assign the default player style for your audio players.
    * The default style can be overridden for each post on the post edit screen.
    * A `beyondwords_player_styles` filter is available so you can modify the options of the "Player style" select boxes in WordPress admin.
    * We are currently beta testing a video. To discuss enabling this for your project please contact [support@beyondwords.io](mailto:support@beyondwords.io).
    * For more information on the supported styles see `playerStyle` at [https://github.com/beyondwords-io/player/blob/main/doc/player-settings.md].
* "Delete audio" option added into "Bulk actions".

**Fixes**

* Fixed the "Remove" button for the Inspect panel in Classic Editor.
* BeyondWords errors now show in the Classic Editor metabox.
* The "Language" and "Voice" selectors now show in the Classic Editor metabox.

= 4.0.6 =

Release date: 7th September 2023

**Fixes**

* Always call `setAttributes` for `beyondwordsMarker` in the `editor.BlockEdit` filter. Previously this was only being called when the BeyondWords sidebar panel was open.
* Remove the unwanted `blocks.getSaveContent.props` filter. This was doing nothing because the filter name was incorrect (it was a typo for `blocks.getSaveContent.extraProps` which we don't need).

= 4.0.5 =

Release date: 24th August 2023

**Fixes**

* Fix reported PHP Warnings by checking that [get_current_screen](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_current_screen/) return value is truthy.

= 4.0.4 =

Release date: 17th August 2023

**Fixes**

* Fix an intermittent issue where segment markers are not always assigned to blocks. Our `blocks.registerBlockType` filter now matches [the example in the official WordPress docs](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/filters/block-filters/#blocks-registerblocktype).
* Hide the audio player widget (the player docked to the bottom of the screen when you scroll) in WordPress admin screens.

= 4.0.3 =

Release date: 4th August 2023

**Fixes**

* Cast the return value of [get_the_post_thumbnail_url](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_the_post_thumbnail_url/) to string before sending to the BeyondWords API. This fixes an issue where we were sending boolean `false` as the `image_url` field for posts without a featured image.

= 4.0.2 =

Release date: 3rd August 2023

**Fixes**

* Prefix `/languages` and `/voices` endpoints with `/organization` to reflect recent changes in API. This fixes the issue where no languages or voices could be found.

= 4.0.1 =

Release date: 30th July 2023

**Fixes**

* Set minimum supported versions to PHP 7.4 and WordPress 5.8.
* Fix issue where the audio player was disappearing in Classic Editor when the Player UI setting was "Headless" or "Disabled".
* Remove unwanted console logs.

= 4.0.0 =

Release date: 26th July 2023

**Fixes**

* Fixed broken "Copy" button in Block editor Inspect panel.

**Improvements**

* API calls are now made to the new BeyondWords REST API at [api.beyondwords.io](https://api.beyondwords.io).
* Custom languages and voices for your audio. [Docs here](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress/add-languages?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=&utm_content=plugin).
* Our advanced "Latest" audio player is available. [Docs here](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress/updating-to-the-latest-player?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=&utm_content=plugin).
* Using "Headless mode" you can take advantage of audio processing and the audio CMS whilst building their own front-end players. [Docs here](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress/headless-mode?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=&utm_content=plugin).
* The following new filters have been added.
    * [beyondwords_body_params](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress/wordpress-filters/beyondwords_body_params?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=&utm_content=plugin).
    * [beyondwords_content_id](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress/wordpress-filters/beyondwords_content_id?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=&utm_content=plugin)
    * [beyondwords_player_script_onload](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress/wordpress-filters/beyondwords_player_script_onload?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=&utm_content=plugin)
    * [beyondwords_player_sdk_params](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress/wordpress-filters/beyondwords_player_sdk_params?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=&utm_content=plugin)
    * [beyondwords_post_audio_enabled_blocks](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress/wordpress-filters/beyondwords_post_audio_enabled_blocks?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=&utm_content=plugin)
    * [beyondwords_project_id](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress/wordpress-filters/beyondwords_project_id?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=&utm_content=plugin)

**Breaking changes**

* `beyondwords_podcast_id` is now stored and retrieved as `beyondwords_content_id`.
    * This should not affect most websites, but if your site has custom PHP that uses the `beyondwords_podcast_id` custom field then you need to update your code to prefer `beyondwords_content_id`.
    * Existing `beyondwords_podcast_id` post metadata will be updated to `beyondwords_content_id` automatically as each post is queried in WordPress requests.
* For WpGraphQL, `beyondwords.podcastId` was defined as type: `Int`. We have changed the type to `String` to support the new ID format (UUID). Your code may need to be updated to handle this change.
* Removed built-in WPML support (our compatibility unfortunately failed over time). Support for translation plugins can now be achieved using the following WordPress hooks:
    * `beyondwords_body_params`
    * `beyondwords_project_id`
* Some older deprecated filters have been removed:
    * `speechkit_post_types`: Migrate to `beyondwords_post_types`
    * `speechkit_post_statuses`: Migrate to `beyondwords_post_statuses`
    * `sk_player_before`: Migrate to beyondwords_js_player_html / beyondwords_amp_player_html
    * `sk_the_content`: Migrate to `beyondwords_js_player_html` / `beyondwords_amp_player_html`
    * `sk_player_after` Migrate to `beyondwords_js_player_html` / `beyondwords_amp_player_html`
    * `speechkit_js_player_html` Migrate to `beyondwords_js_player_html`
    * `speechkit_amp_player_html` Migrate to `beyondwords_amp_player_html`
    * `speechkit_post_player_enabled` Migrate to `beyondwords_post_player_enabled`

= 3.10.0 =

Release date: 4th November 2022

**Enhancements**

* BeyondWords now has improved [Elementor](https://elementor.com/) compatibility!
    * We’ve added a “BeyondWords” tab into the Elementor [Page Settings Panel](https://developers.elementor.com/docs/editor/page-settings-panel/).
    * Use the controls in this tab to generate audio, toggle player visibility, and preview audio.
    * If you experience any Elementor compatibility issues after this update please email [support@beyondwords.io](mailto:support@beyondwords.io).

**Compatible with WordPress 5.8 or greater**

* [WordPress core dropped support for IE in version 5.8](https://wordpress.org/news/2021/05/dropping-support-for-internet-explorer-11/) released July 2021.
* The official [wp-scripts](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-scripts/) package we use does not produce IE-friendly code, so we have adjusted our minimum supported WordPress version to 5.8.

**Enhancements**

* Hide audio controls for blocks if the post does not have audio.
* Partial source code linting (using `wp-scripts lint-js --fix`).

= 3.9.0 =

Release date: 22nd September 2022

**Enhancements**

* Added a "Remove" button into the Inspect panel to clear BeyondWords data for individual posts.
* Delete audio data in BeyondWords API when a post is trashed or deleted in WordPress. Restoring the post in WordPress will restore the audio data in BeyondWords.

**Fixes**

* Don't register the `_speechkit_disable_generate_audio` custom field. This plugin v2.x field has not been used in a while, so there is no need to register it.

**Continuous Integration**

* The Docker config for local development now closely matches our CI config – they now both use [WP CLI](https://wp-cli.org/) to download and install WordPress.
* Improvements to our [CodeCeption](https://codeception.com/) test suites to fix an intermittent MySQL error.

= 3.7.0 =

Release date: 11th August 2022

**Important developer notice**

* In this update our plugin instance has been renamed from `$speechkit_wordpress_plugin` to `$beyondwords_wordpress_plugin`.
* Please do not access the plugin instance directly in your code. The objects and methods it contains are intended for internal use, and over time they are likely to change.
* Instead, use the [documented WordPress filters](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs/integrations/wordpress/wordpress-filters) and contact our team via [hello@beyondwords.io](mailto:hello@beyondwords.io) if you need new actions or filters to achieve your goals.

**Enhancements**

* Automatically clear all `beyondwords_*` and `speechkit_*` data when the plugin is uninstalled.
* Add BeyondWords section to 'Tools' > 'Site Health'.
* 'Bulk actions' > 'Generate audio' now regenerates audio if it already exists (bulk processing previously "Skipped" posts which already had audio).
* Replace remaining instances of "SpeechKit" brand name with "BeyondWords".
    * There were still instances where the former brand name for BeyondWords was being used throughout the code - mostly in the names for custom fields and filters.
    * These have now all been updated, maintaining support for older posts with `speechkit_*` data.
* Improve "Pending review" support.
    * When a post is saved in WordPress we now send `{ published: true|false }` to the BeyondWords API.
    * This is primarily to prevent audio appearing in BeyondWords playlists for posts which are saved as "pending" in WordPress.

**Fixes**

* Add `isset()` checks for `$beyondwords_wordpress_plugin->player` to prevent PHP "Undefined property" errors.

= 3.6.1 =

Release date: 6th May 2022

**Fixes**

* When posts were saved using the WordPress Block Editor multiple BeyondWords API calls could be made. This resulted in the "Skipped" status for audio, and a fix for this has been added.
* Handle responses saved as object of class `WP_Error`. Older posts edited with v2.x of our plugin could have an unexpected `WP_Error` in a custom field. We now handle this, fixing a reported PHP error on the Post Edit screen.

= 3.6.0 =

Release date: 29th April 2022

**Enhancements**

* Expose BeyondWords data in GraphQL to support decoupled frontends. Post types which are supported by **both** BeyondWords and [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/) have the following fields in GraphQL:

    * `beyondwords.projectId`

**Code Coverage**

    * Using the deprecated filters in v3.x will log a `_doing_it_wrong()` error.
    * In v4.0 the legacy filters will be removed.

**Fixes**

* Replace `WP_PLUGIN_DIR` and `WP_PLUGIN_URL` constants with `plugin_dir_path()` and `plugin_dir_url()` to improve multisite support.

**BeyondWords is the new name for SpeechKit.**

* All user-facing instances of `SpeechKit` have been replaced with `BeyondWords`.
* For a smooth transition, behind-the-scenes we have retained the following for the time being:
    * **Filters**, **custom fields** and **plugin options** are still prefixed as `speechkit_*`
    * DOM IDs and class names are still `speechkit-*`.
    * The plugin slug and text-domain are still `speechkit`
    * Requests to BeyondWords services are still made to speechkit.io domains.

* To improve stability and security, we no longer attempt to send data from SpeechKit to your WordPress site. We only send data from your site to SpeechKit.

**Deprecations**

* The iFrame player has been replaced by the JavaScript SDK, with the exception of the AMP player which still uses iFrame.
* The "SpeechKit Status" column on the Posts screen no longer displays the processing status. The processing status is now shown in the JavaScript SDK player of the WordPress admin screens.
